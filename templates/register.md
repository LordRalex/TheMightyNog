Thank you for registering!

Before any of my registered only features start working, 
let me inform you that I will be storing personal information 
such as your username in my database and that this information will be considered public.

At any time you can let the author - iScrE4m - know, 
that you'd like to view all stored information about you, 
or that you want it all to be forgotten (deleted, no going back).

If you agree with all this, please respond with `!consent yes` and you'll be 
able to start enjoying the benefits of registered users. If you disagree, 
let me know with `!consent no` and I will forget that you ever asked.
